Hello everybody, this is the first website that I've coded from scratch.

The body is designed to collapse from three columns to one at a breakpoint of 980 pixels.
The header collapses from three columns to two, with the information from the first column then appearing in the body of the homepage.

Thanks so much for taking a look, all advice is appreciated.

Thank you!
